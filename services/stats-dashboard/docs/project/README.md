- **OpenAI API Key** - [Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vc-basketball-stats.git
   cd vc-basketball-stats
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db  # Optional for production
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key for AI analysis | Yes | - |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (production) | No | SQLite (local) |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | Enable Flask debug mode | No | `False` |
| `PORT` | Port to run the application | No | `5000` |

### Database Configuration

- **Development**: Uses SQLite by default (`basketball_stats.db`)
- **Production**: Set `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL (recommended for Railway/Heroku)

### OpenAI Model Configuration

The application intelligently selects models based on task complexity:
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Quick insights, UI text generation
- **GPT-4o**: Main analysis, player diagnostics, game recaps
- **GPT-4**: Season-wide processing (long context)

## 📖 Usage

### Available Pages

1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - Season overview with advanced metrics and AI insights
2. **Games** (`/games`) - Complete box scores for all games with search and filter
3. **Players** (`/players`) - Player profiles with advanced stats and game logs
4. **Trends** (`/trends`) - Interactive charts showing team and player performance
5. **Analysis** (`/analysis`) - AI-generated comprehensive season analysis
6. **AI Coach** (`/ai-insights`) - Custom AI-powered queries and diagnostics

### Using the AI Coach

Navigate to the AI Insights page and enter queries like:
- "Analyze Gavin's shooting efficiency trends"
- "What are our main weaknesses in losses?"
- "Compare our performance in first vs second half"
- "Which players have the most consistent scoring?"

## 🧮 Advanced Metrics Explained

### Shooting Efficiency

**eFG% (Effective Field Goal Percentage)**
```
eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 × 3PM) / FGA × 100
```
Accounts for the added value of three-point shots. League average is ~50%.

**TS% (True Shooting Percentage)**
```
TS% = PTS / (2 × (FGA + 0.44 × FTA)) × 100
```
Most comprehensive shooting metric, includes free throws. Elite shooters are above 60%.

**PPP (Points Per Possession)**
```
PPP = PTS / Estimated Possessions
```
Measures offensive efficiency. Above 1.0 is good, above 1.1 is excellent.

### Usage & Role Metrics

**Usage Proxy**
```
Usage% = (FGA + 0.44 × FTA + TO) / Team Total × 100
```
Estimates percentage of team possessions used by a player.

**Scoring Share**
```
Scoring Share% = Player PTS / Team PTS × 100
```
Percentage of team scoring contributed by a player.

**Player Roles** (Auto-classified):
- 🌟 **Primary Scorer**: Usage >20%, Scoring Share >20%
- ⚙️ **Role Player**: Usage 15-20%
- 🔧 **Supporting Role**: Usage <15%

### Consistency Metrics

**Volatility Measures**:
- PPG Range: Difference between highest and lowest scoring games
- FG% Standard Deviation: Shooting consistency
- TO Standard Deviation: Turnover consistency

Lower volatility = more consistent performance.

### Win Condition Analysis

Identifies statistical thresholds for wins:
- "Team is 7-0 when TO ≤ 13"
- "Team is 4-1 when scoring 50+ points"
- Compares averages in wins vs losses

## 🤖 AI Analysis System

### Capabilities

The AI system provides data-driven insights using OpenAI's GPT models:

- **Player Performance Diagnosis**: Identifies trends, strengths, and areas for improvement
- **Game Root Cause Analysis**: Explains what led to wins or losses
- **Season Pattern Detection**: Finds statistical trends and correlations
- **Win Condition Identification**: Determines what the team needs to do to win
- **Tactical Recommendations**: Suggests adjustments based on data

### Design Philosophy

✅ **Data-Driven**: All insights derived from box score statistics
✅ **Transparent**: Shows which stats inform each conclusion
✅ **Honest**: Acknowledges limitations and data gaps
✅ **Actionable**: Provides specific, measurable recommendations

❌ **No Speculation**: Won't infer things not in the data
❌ **No Assumptions**: Won't guess about player effort, coaching decisions, or momentum
❌ **No Overreach**: Won't claim to know defensive matchups or shot locations beyond stats

### AI Model Selection

| Task | Model | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| Season summaries | GPT-4o | Long context, comprehensive analysis |
| Player diagnostics | GPT-4o | Detailed evaluation with nuance |
| Game recaps | GPT-4o | Balanced quality and speed |
| Quick insights | GPT-4o-mini | Fast, cost-effective for short text |

### Example AI Insights

```json
{
  "insight": "Team struggles with turnovers in close games (avg 16.2 in losses vs 11.4 in wins)",
  "supporting_data": {
    "avg_to_losses": 16.2,
    "avg_to_wins": 11.4,
    "correlation": -0.72
  },
  "recommendation": "Focus on ball security in high-pressure situations"
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Address already in use" Error**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

**❌ OpenAI API Errors**
- Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`
- Verify API key is active at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Check rate limits and billing status

**❌ Stats Not Updating**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Restart the Flask application
- Check `data/` directory for updated JSON files

**❌ Database Connection Issues**
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db`
- Check network connectivity to database
- Ensure database exists and user has permissions

**❌ Charts Not Displaying**
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Verify internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)
- Try a different browser

**❌ Import Errors**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11+
```
