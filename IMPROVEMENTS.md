## ✅ Done

### Rules Engine (services/insight-engine)
- **Rule 11 — Scoring Drought**: Alert after 6 consecutive missed field goals (priority: important)
- **Rule 12 — Depth Warning**: Alert when 2+ active players simultaneously have 3+ fouls (priority: important)
- **Rule 13 — PPP Efficiency Gap**: Alert when opponent PPP exceeds ours by ≥0.25 after both teams have ≥15 possessions (priority: important)
- **Rule 14 — Period-End Urgency**: Alert once when clock enters ≤18s window in Q1/Q2/Q3 (priority: info)
- **Rule 15 — Opponent FT Bombardment**: Alert when opponent draws 6+ FT trips in recent 10 events (priority: important)
- New InsightTypes added: `scoring_drought`, `depth_warning`, `efficiency`, `leverage`

### Coach Dashboard (apps/coach-dashboard)
- Labels registered for all 4 new insight types
- `depth_warning` added to the Action Items panel (requires immediate response)
- Live scoreboard now shows **PPP** (points per possession, after ≥5 possessions) and **FT Rate** (FTA/FGA) instead of the less-actionable POSS and SUBS columns

### Realtime API (services/realtime-api)
- GPT refresh throttled: every **8 events** (was 3) / **45 seconds** (was 20). Rules engine covers moment-to-moment; GPT reserved for synthesis. Both still env-overridable via `BTA_LIVE_INSIGHT_REFRESH_EVERY_EVENTS` and `BTA_LIVE_INSIGHT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`.

### iPad Operator (apps/ipad-operator)
- **Periodic offline flush**: every 15s during a live game, if `navigator.onLine` and pending events exist, retries the queue. Fixes iOS/mobile case where the native `online` event never fires after reconnect.
- **Instant undo**: removed confirmation dialog — `undoLast()` removes the last event immediately with haptic feedback and a toast. No friction under pressure.
- **MAKE/MISS split buttons**: left panel has 6 dedicated shot buttons (MAKE 2 / MISS 2, MAKE 3 / MISS 3, FT MAKE / FT MISS) — 2 taps to log any shot outcome without a modal toggle.
- **Semantic color coding**: shot buttons are green (make), red (miss), blue (3PT make), amber (3PT miss) — outcome colors for faster muscle memory.
- **FOUL and TURNOVER promoted**: moved to top of right stat grid; foul is amber, turnover is red. Both visually distinct from neutral stats.
- **UNDO button pending-event badge**: orange pill badge on the Undo nav button shows exact count of unsynced events (`pendingEvents.length`). Operator always knows their queue depth at a glance. (`apps/ipad-operator/src/App.tsx`, `styles.css`)
- **Live eFG% on scoreboard**: added `fgMade3`/`fgAttempts3` to `TeamShootingStats` in `game-state`; populated in `shot_attempt` handler when `event.points === 3`; coach dashboard scoreboard now shows eFG% cell `(FGM + 0.5×3PM) / FGA` alongside 3PT breakdown.
- **GPT output validation**: length guard (10–300 chars) discards malformed/bloated GPT messages; all AI coaching insights prefixed with `[AI]` so coaches can distinguish model-generated advice from rules-engine alerts.
- **Optimistic Local State**: `postEvent` adds events to `pendingEvents` immediately on tap; display state (scores, feed) derives from both `submittedEvents` and `pendingEvents` so UI updates instantly without waiting for the server round-trip.
- **Smarter Run Detection (Rule 7)**: Replaced "last 10 events" sliding window with `computeUninterruptedRun` — walks backwards through scoring events counting consecutive unanswered points. Alerts are now "opponent 8-0 run (started Q2) — call timeout" and "we're on a 10-0 run — keep the pressure on."
- **Clutch Rule Entry Guard (Rule 5)**: Alert fires only once when clock first crosses below 120s in Q4/OT, not on every subsequent event in the window.
- **Sub Suggestion Intelligence (Rule 9)**: When bench is empty and a player has 4 fouls (not fouled out), suggests a timeout for scheme adjustment instead of an impossible sub.
- **Possession Inference (Rule 13 + scoreboard)**: Rule 13 and the coach dashboard PPP column both fall back to inferred possessions (FGA + turnovers) when no explicit `possession_start` events exist.
- **Historical Context TTL at Period Transitions**: `refreshGameAiInsights` and `requestAiChatResponse` force a historical context refresh on `period_transition` events in addition to the time-based TTL.

## 🟢 Low Priority / Long-Term

### 9. Matchup Tracking
**What**: Track which defender is assigned to which offensive player each possession. Enables "their #23 is 4-for-4 against your zone" style insights.
**Complexity**: Requires operator workflow change — they'd need to log matchup assignments. New event type or annotation on existing events. Significant schema change.
**Files**: `packages/shared-schema/src/types.ts`, game-state, insight engine, operator UI.

### 10. Lineup +/- Tracking
**What**: Track net point differential while each 5-man lineup is on the court. 

**What's needed**: Game state needs to record when each lineup combination started and what the score was. Currently substitution events exist but differential per lineup isn't computed.
**Use case**: "Your starting lineup is +12 but your second unit is -8 — the gap is real."
**Files**: `packages/game-state/src/index.ts`, coach dashboard.

### 11. Timeout Budget Awareness
**What**: Currently timeouts-left is shown on the scoreboard. Missing: urgency scaling. With 2 timeouts left in Q4 down 6, one should be automatically flagged as "save it."
**Fix**: Add a timeout conservation rule to the insight engine that fires when timeouts fall below 2 in Q4/OT with the game within reach.
**Files**: `services/insight-engine/src/index.ts`.

### 12. Coach Dashboard — Insight Age Display
**What**: Insights show the message but not when they were generated. An insight about a scoring drought from 3 minutes ago may no longer be relevant.
**Fix**: Show relative time (`2m ago`) next to each insight. The `createdAtIso` field is already on every `LiveInsight`.
**Files**: `apps/coach-dashboard/src/App.tsx` — insight card render.

## Architecture Observations (Don't Change Without Discussion)

- **Don't add direct app-to-app imports.** All shared logic goes through `packages/*`. Currently clean — keep it that way.
- **Game state must stay deterministic.** `replayEvents` must produce identical output given identical input. No Date.now() or randomness in `applyEvent`.
- **GPT is additive, not authoritative.** Rules engine output always shows; GPT is a layer on top. If GPT fails, the rules engine fallback handles it cleanly. Never make the coach view dependent on a GPT response.
- **File-backed persistence is dev-only.** `services/realtime-api/.platform-data` is fine locally. Production requires `DATABASE_URL` for Postgres.
- **Vite ports are strict**: operator on 5174, dashboard on 5173. Both fail if occupied.
